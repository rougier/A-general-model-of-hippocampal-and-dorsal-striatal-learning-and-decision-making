  abstract  = "Humans and other animals use multiple strategies for making
               decisions. Reinforcement-learning theory distinguishes between
               stimulus-response (model-free; MF) learning and deliberative
               (model-based; MB) planning. The spatial-navigation literature
               presents a parallel dichotomy between navigation strategies. In
               ``response learning,'' associated with the dorsolateral striatum
               (DLS), decisions are anchored to an egocentric reference frame.
               In ``place learning,'' associated with the hippocampus,
               decisions are anchored to an allocentric reference frame.
               Emerging evidence suggests that the contribution of hippocampus
               to place learning may also underlie its contribution to MB
               learning by representing relational structure in a cognitive
               map. Here, we introduce a computational model in which
               hippocampus subserves place and MB learning by learning a
               ``successor representation'' of relational structure between
               states; DLS implements model-free response learning by learning
               associations between actions and egocentric representations of
               landmarks; and action values from either system are weighted by
               the reliability of its predictions. We show that this model
               reproduces a range of seemingly disparate behavioral findings in
               spatial and nonspatial decision tasks and explains the effects
               of lesions to DLS and hippocampus on these tasks. Furthermore,
               modeling place cells as driven by boundaries explains the
               observation that, unlike navigation guided by landmarks,
               navigation guided by boundaries is robust to ``blocking'' by
               prior state-reward associations due to learned associations
               between place cells. Our model, originally shaped by detailed
               constraints in the spatial literature, successfully
               characterizes the hippocampal-striatal system as a general
               system for decision making via adaptive combination of
               stimulus-response learning and the use of a cognitive map.",

  author    = "Pearce, J M and Roberts, A D and Good, M",
  abstract  = "Animals can find a hidden goal in several ways. They might use a
               cognitive map that encodes information about the geometric
               relationship between the goal and two or more landmarks.
               Alternatively, they might use a heading vector that specifies
               the direction and distance of the goal from a single landmark.
               Rats with damage to the hippocampus have difficulty in finding a
               hidden goal. Here we determine which of the above strategies is
               affected by such damage. Rats were required to swim in a water
               maze to a submerged platform, which was always at the same
               distance and direction from a landmark. The platform and
               landmark remained in the same place for the four trials of each
               session, but they were moved to a new position at the start of a
               session. Rats with damage to the hippocampus found the platform
               more efficiently than did normal rats in the first trial of a
               session but, in contrast to normal rats, their performance did
               not improve during a session. Our results indicate that
               hippocampally damaged rats are able to navigate by means of
               heading vectors but not cognitive maps.",
